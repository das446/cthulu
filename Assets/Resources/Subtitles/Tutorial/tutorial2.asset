  text: Nice throw! But be careful, furniture will break after its been thrown too
    many times. If a buyer sees broken furniture they'll become less interested in
    the house, decreasing their willingness to buy the home. Try cleaning it up! To
    clean up a mess, use the LMB when close to a mess.
