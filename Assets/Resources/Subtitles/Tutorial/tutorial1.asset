  text: "Welcome to Surreal Estate! \n\nThis house is infested with monsters, ghosts,
    and all sorts of nasty baddies! But you can't let any buyers know that, or they'll
    be running for the hills. So you have to use your wits, strength, and a basic
    understanding of managing opportunity costs to beat back the monsters and sell
    this house! \n\nYou can use all kinds of furniture to block, hit, and hide the
    creatures that pop up around your house.\n\nTry picking up that vase on the table,
    and give it a good throw! Use the LMB to pick up an object, then throw it by pressing
    the LMB again\n\n"
