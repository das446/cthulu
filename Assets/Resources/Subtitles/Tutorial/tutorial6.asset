  text: Well, it looks like the sucker - I mean buyer - wants to make an offer! Ues
    the LMB to accept it! Or you can instead offer to show him more of the house to
    further whet his appetite and increase the amount of money he's willing to part

    has to run into a monster and run away screaming!
